​	Hey there! So it seems you've downloaded the ever so lovingly called 'Horse Dispenser'! As you can tell from the title it is! A horse! Dispenser! Fantastic. It's quick and easy process to install this program. (Although if you're reading this you've probably already downloaded and installed this but y'know) Just hit the .exe file for the installer, accept the terms and conditions and voila! Horse dispenser.

​	Now, you may be asking, how exactly does this program dispense horses? Well that's an amazing question. The original plan for this was to locate the closest horse and give you all it's information and statistics. By providing the horse's location it essentially spawned your horse and you were to be free to do with that information what you will. However, there were a few legal issues brought up by our team here and that idea was unfortunately scrapped. What this program really does, is it gives you a location of a totally fake horse with an entirely randomized info set! There are various stats your horse can have including but not limited to, dance ability, horoscope belief levels, and ability to make coffee. The dispenser part comes from the small animation of when your horse is 'dispensed' to you and the info comes up on your screen!

​	If you love the horse dispenser so much you want to add to it, by all means go ahead! If you plan to rerelease it on your own terms, just give our team a heads up and just a little bit of credit! This program is a craft so lovingly made by our dev team that it would be a shame if they went unrecognized for their efforts.

​	Anyways! Thank you for downloading and enjoy the horse dispenser!
